## Title: Technical Communication

#### Purpose: To describe how resume is hosted on my static website

#### Prerequisite

#### Instructions






Your README has two goals:
1. Describe the practical steps of how to host and format a resume using the software stack
you used for this assignment. The most common one is Markdown, VS Code, GitHub
Pages, and Jekyll.

2. Relate the practical steps described above to the general principles of current Technical
Writing, as explained in Andrew Etter's book Modern Technical Writing
Each README must contain these topics/components:

1. Title
2. Purpose: describe the README's purpose (see above)
3. Prerequisites: This should include a resume formatted in Markdown
Include a link to a good Markdown tutorial under "More Resources." You do not need
to explain how to use Markdown.
4. Instructions, including animated gif
Use headings and numbered lists
Remember to use each step to explain
both how to follow the tools and model Etter
recommends and how to host a resume in GitHub Pages or Codeberg Pages. It's up to
you whether you 1) begin with Etter's general process and then demonstrate the
process with a practical step involving your resume, or 2) begin with the practical
steps for hosting a resume and relate each practical step to a concept in Etter's book.
Add an animated gif: Include a demo using an animated gif in your README. The gif
should feature your own resume (showing your own name).
More Resources - include:
1. a Markdown tutorial
2. a link to Etter's book
3. at least one other resource
5. Authors and Acknowledgments: credit template authors and group members
6. FAQs - add (and answer) two FAQs, as described below:
1. A question about the overall process, such as "Why is Markdown better than a word
processor?"
2. A question about the practical details, such as "Why is my resume not showing up?"
You may use the example FAQs, or come up with your own.
